* 1. Name:
*      -Emily Raventos-
* 2. Assignment Name:
*      Lab 01: Hello World
* 3. Assignment Description:
*      A simple program to display a message on the screen
* 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
*      - This was a pretty straight forward lab. I was a little confused when I downloaded the zip 
*      file and not everything matched the video, but after that it went fine.-
* 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
*      - About 2 hours. Writing the actual code took maybe 45 seconds. The majority of the time was 
*      spent going through the reading again, making sure I had everything set up correctly
*      and trying to find the correct files.-
